the main job in my article :
my article has three mudules in the main frame,the first part is about making actions,int this part, we used the probility greedy strategy firstly,
and then we used the OPQ algorithm to make more actions, we also use crossover and mutation to exclude our actions set ,besides,we take the
FSO algorithm to assure the basic action.the second part is about selecting the optimal feasible offloading action,in this part ,we take the way to 
caculate the Q value for each single action, and we select the minimum.The last part is the offloading policy update module, we take action and update
our net int this part.

my job:
I write some parts in this article which are revised by my tutor, and I do most experiments in my article and talk the new ideas with my tutor.
I also draw experimental diagrams and flowcharts.

the innovation in the article:
firstly,we consider the facts int real time. secondly, we use the deep reinforcement learning to solve the problem of the tradeoff about time and 
energy in mobile edge computing.


shortcomings in my job:
we need to change the net module to update the action ,and we can use the GPU to train our network module. we also take the complicated tasks
into our consideration to simulate tasks which are completed in the real world.
